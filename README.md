Test 1
This the code i got from following a John Watson's tutorial on Youtube. (Feel free to change the asin)

Test 2
The code simple scrapes the webpage and gets you the Title (details) of the product on that page and outputs it's asin at the end.


Test 3
This is an advancement of the code in Test 2, not only does it output the Title (details) and asin of the page it also outputs the price of the product on that webpage.


Test 4
This is a major alteration to the code and enables you to scrape the webpage of multiple products, all you have to do is input their asin's into a csv file called "products".
The code will retrieve the asin's from the csv and output the contents on those webpages one-by-one."# Scraping-Amazon-in-2023"
